# TikTok Claims Prediction Model
This project's goal is to build a classification model that predicts whether a video is a claim or opinion.

# 1 | Exploring the Dataset
The goal of this first notebook is to explore and understand the 2019 TikTok Claims data aand present our findings.

- Of the 19,382 samples in this dataset, just over 50% (9,608 items) are claims.
- Engagement level is strongly correlated with claim status. This should be a focus of further inquiry.
- Videos with banned authors have significantly higher engagement than videos with active authors. Videos with authors under review fall between these two categories in terms of engagement levels.</br></br>

# 2 | Statistical Analysis
The goal of this second notebook is to characterize and clean the 2019 TikTok Claims data set and to create a visualization to share to stakeholders.

- We plot histograms of various metrics of user engagement (views, likes, comments, shares, and downloads) to see the distribution of data.

# 3 | Building the Model
Under Construction. . .
</br></br>

## Observations & Patterns
- Over 200 null values were found in 7 different columns. As a result, future modeling should consider the null values to avoid making insights that would assume complete data.

- Video view and like counts are all concentrated on the low end of 1,000 for opinions. Therefore, the data distribution is right-skewed, which will inform the models and model types that will be built.
